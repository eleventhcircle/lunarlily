# 🌙 lunarlily

Welcome to the repo for my personal site [lunarlily](https://lunarlily.neocities.org)!  
  
My site is built with Eleventy and hosted on Neocities. v2.0 is now 100% coded by me! Many thanks to [itinerae](https://www.itinerae.org/) for her free site templates, I don't think I would have committed to starting a personal site without a template as a stepping stone :]  
  
I can't promise my code is completely neat and tidy, but feel free to take a look around regardless. If you have any questions, drop them in my [guestbook](https://lunarlily.neocities.org/guestbook/) or [my email](mailto:bunflora@proton.me)!
