          It's been somewhere around two months since I put lunarlily out into the world, and it's still a little strange knowing it exists and people can see it (and <i>have</i> seen it! And are excited for me to update it! Wowie!!). I intended to have a journal entry up on the site by now - more than one, ideally... but then I went and got myself sick instead! A real nice viral infection that started a couple days before my birthday. It put me in bed for a solid two weeks; I didn't do very much with myself other than sniffle and sneeze and sleep. And then a bunch of work and life things happened as they're wont to do, which delayed this even longer... So please allow me to extend a very overdue welcome to my little corner of the web!
        </p><br>
        <p>
          You might be wondering, <i>"So what kind of place is this exactly?"</i> And if I can be honest? I don't know for sure yet! Right now I'd describe lunarlily as a personal site, somewhere that I can put my silly little images and words and whatever else I come up with. Maybe it'll evolve beyond that in the future? Maybe it won't. Either way, I'm not setting any restrictions on myself or what I make - I find I do better if I approach these sorts of things with as little expectation as possible, otherwise I end up feeling boxed in by what I "should" or "shouldn't" do instead of just letting loose and seeing what happens. I've only got one real "rule," as it were:
        </p><br>
        <p>
          <center><strong>Whatever I choose to create here must, before anything else, be something that I made for <i>me</i>.</strong></center>
        </p><br>
        <p>
          Of course, I'm very grateful for whoever might stop by and take a look around on their websurfing journey! I hope any visitors now and in the future enjoy their time here, and maybe even find something that makes them smile. But for this to be something I stick to long-term, it has to be something I do for myself first. If I start considering a potential audience too hard I think my head will explode from the stress, and that just doesn't sound very fun to clean up after.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the first project in a long time that I've actually finished (as much as a personal site can ever be, I suppose) and I'm quite proud of that! It's reassuring to know that I'm capable of just... <i>doing</i> the things that I want to do, if I put my mind to it and have a little encouragement. It's ok if it's not perfect - hell, it doesn't even have to be GOOD. It can just <i>be</i>. I think I forgot that, in the course of everything that's happened over the last few years. Feels really nice to be able to go <i>(jazz hands)</i> Hey look, I made a thing!
        </p><br>
        <p>
          I thought it'd be good to talk a bit about why I started lunarlily in the first place, to serve as a reminder to future me of why I'm doing this and maybe some form of insight or encouragement(?) for anyone else out there considering carving out a little slice of internet for themselves.
        </p>

          You see: I am an absolute coward.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both online and off I am painfully reserved - always a lurker, never a participant. Rarely do I stray outside of my little bubble, to interact and share my opinions or creations or whatever else with anyone other than a few trusted friends (hard won in the times I did find enough courage to step out of that bubble). I'm scared of not expressing myself "correctly," of coming across in a way I don't intend and being misunderstood. I'm scared of doing things "wrong." I'm scared of opening myself up to ridicule or unsolicited critique or mockery. I'm scared of taking up space. I'm deeply scared of being perceived. I'm scared by how little I value the things I say or do simply because I am the one who said or made them. I'm scared of being bad at something and having anyone witness it, and especially of having to face the idea that maybe I'll never be good at anything at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          But y'know what? Fuck it! Here I am anyway! Making a thing and sharing it! Putting myself out there to be perceived! Sharing my thoughts despite doubting their value! Writing about stuff that I like, even if nobody else really cares! Trying to participate in a new (to me) community! Why? Well... I wish I could say something profound here, but to be frank, I think it's mostly because I'm pushing 30 and I'm really god damn tired of being scared all the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Making things and sharing them, especially nowadays, is vulnerable in a way that's unfamiliar and uncomfortable to me. When I sit down to make anything - whether it's some type of handicraft, trying to learn a new software or skill, writing original stories and fanfic, talking about OCs with friends, sharing my own headcanons about beloved characters... hell, even something as inconsequential as <i>a goofy tweet about Some Thing I Like</i>, which I'm even not sure can truly count as "making" anything, but regardless - I question every possible little decision in the process, and then I question my indecisiveness, and then I question who would even want to see it if I do manage to finish, and <i>then</i> I question why I'm even bothering at all, spiraling round and round in a mire of frustration and insecurity until I give up in silence.
        </p>
        <p>
          <small>(With great awareness of the irony, I must acknowledge the month and a half it's taken to even write <i>this</i> post in the first place. Its existence anywhere outside of my hard drive is a marvel.)</small>
        </p>
        <p>
          It's exhausting. I hate it. I can point to a thousand reasons why I got to this place, a thousand times over so many years that I tried and failed to stop it and let it grow into this monstrous thing, a thousand self-reflections and promises to do better... but I don't think the first step towards change needs to be anything like that, at least for me. I just don't want to feel like this anymore. That is enough of a reason to try.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          And so, lunarlily is my first earnest attempt at pushing back. I want to look this ridiculous beast in its face, take its measure and accept it instead of just crumbling under its weight. I want to learn how to walk with it instead. I want to find the grace to let myself be bad at things, over and over until I eventually figure out how to be good at them. And with time, I hope I can start to make things I'm proud of. I hope I'll be brave enough to believe that what I think and make and do is worth something. I hope that someday my fear won't feel like an anchor anymore, that the joy of creation and of connecting with others will fill my heart enough to keep my head buoyed above water instead of drowning. I hope you'll be there to see it. I hope, if you have your own beast, you'll push back, too.
        </p>

          And y'know? I kind of already have proof that it's working. Since finishing the site I've felt a noticeable boost in my creative drive, even with getting sick and being a bed potato for a while. I haven't had much desire to make anything in a very long time; it felt like a spark that I couldn't get back, no matter what I tried. I'm sure a lot of different things contributed to it <small>(looking meaningfully at my job and its unending stressors)</small>, but all that fear is probably the biggest culprit. But in August, I felt it... that drive to Create. It was a small and unsure thing, but it stayed, for the first time in I can't remember how long. And create I have! I picked up my yarn again. I made a shitty playlist for one of my favorite characters. I wrote down all my goofy ideas for an AU with my OCs. I dug out a learn-to-bake cookbook I've been sitting on forever. I cracked open my sketchbook for the first time in ages and made some reaaaaal bad doodles in it. I started brainstorming diorama ideas for my nendoroids. I bought <i>miter shears and popsicle sticks.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          It's just... I dunno. It's so freeing to not be afraid of doing what I love. I feel lighter than I have in a long time. And like, imagine where I'll be next August! How much I'll have accomplished and how I'll feel about it then.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          ...now having said all that. I can't deny it feels IMMENSELY awkward to like... talk to myself, essentially? But also while knowing I kind of have an audience?? Made up of both people I know and total strangers???? I figure I'll get used to it eventually but for now it's weird. So uh. If any of this reads as cringe to you, no it doesn't because cringe is dead<3 but also I'm deeply sorry lmao this turned into a much bigger thing than I intended when I first sat down to write. I hope I don't sound preachy or insincere at any point; these are my honest feelings, put to paper (html file?) as best as I could. They might not be graceful, but they're from my heart.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          If you made it to the end, thank you for reading. I hope I see you around sometime :]
