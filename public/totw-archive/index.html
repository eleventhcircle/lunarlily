          Back on my farm game shit again lads (no one was surprised)<br><br>
          I never played the original DS version of GB so I went into it basically blind and I'm having a blast!! My save file is already over 40 hours and I'm not even halfway through year 1 autumn yet, which is wild to me? There's soooo much to do. I wasn't sure if I'd like the bazaar replacing the traditional shipping bin, but I'm slowly figuring out how to put the windmills to good use every week. Balancing between making stuff for the bazaar and more long-term crafting like seed making and building materials is fun, and I <i>really</i> like that the seasonal trends encourage you to focus on more than just growing crops with the best gold-per-day return every month - it's a very refreshing twist on the usual formula, and I think it'll make playing long-term much more enjoyable. Though on the other hand, it kinda sucks to get a bad combo of trends for a season lol<br><br>
          Going in blind included not knowing anything about everyone in town. Usually I don't mind reading or watching stuff about characters beforehand in a farm sim (it's part of the fun of anticipating a new game imo), but I felt like trying something new this time. I was curious how I'd like getting to know the townspeople organically - so far, very glad I gave it a shot! I've been pleasantly surprised several times in heart events as I get closer to everyone. The voice acting is incredibly well done too. I adore every performance but Mayor Felix is my favorite, you can tell he's having a great time in the booth :]<br><br>
          I could keep yapping for ages and I want to, so look forward to a journal entry at some point in the future when I'm farther into the game. In the meantime, look at my cat. She's so long.

          Been on a real Sunny D kick recently, I'm actually drinking a glass as we speak. I have no idea why? The last time I had any was proooooobably in high school, but I saw a big ol jug at Winco last week and it spoke to something deep in my soul so I stuck it in the cart. Smooth Orange is supreme obviously (I'll confess I was a Tangy Original truther as a tot but I think it's too acidic for me now. I'm so susceptible to heartburn. God. I need to buy more Tums.)

        <p>
          A friend recently introduced me to <a href="https://murdle.com/index.html" target="_blank">Murdle</a>, a daily puzzle solving game in the style of others like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html" target="_blank">Wordle</a> and <a href="https://globle-game.com/game" target="_blank">Globle</a> and <a href="https://costcodle.com/" target="_blank">Costcodle</a>. I'm a big puzzle guy so I added it into my daily rotation immediately lol
        </p>
        <p>
          The game itself is about logical process of elimination - first you go through each clue and use the grid to mark down the facts, then use your deduction skills to fill in the rest of the squares based on what you know is true/false and figure out whodunit. Some days the puzzle will have more categories to keep track of, like motives and suspect statements, while other days will just be the who-what-where wombo combo.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's pretty straightforward but it just really scratches the puzzle itch for me, to the point that I bought a couple of the physical books and I've been chewing through them every night. The four category puzzles drive me nuts in the most fun way possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're someone who likes stretching your brain a bit every day (and honestly even if you aren't!), I heartily recommend giving it a try :]

          I caught the live premiere completely by accident and haven't taken it off repeat since. Eternally grateful to my boyfriend for recently turning me on to Jamie's songs, I really love how she tunes Teto!
