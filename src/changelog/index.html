        <p>Here lives a record of all changes made to lunarlily... ever. Entries are shown in reverse chronological order.</p>

            If you want to keep up with future updates, you can add <a href="http://localhost:8080/feed.xml">my RSS feed</a> to any feed reader and get notified when the site updates.
