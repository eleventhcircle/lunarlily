            There isn't anything outright explicit on this site, but there will likely be swearing and occasional sexual/crude humor scattered around (especially in the journal). Please keep this in mind, and if you're a minor please curate your space accordingly.

            As with all personal sites, things are forever under construction and subject to change on a whim. If you come across anything broken (or that seems like it), feel free to drop an email or a message on the guestbook and I'll take a look!

            My bestie <span class="subtletext">(if ur reading this hiii)</span> dropped this in my DMs back in early December, so I suppose this is technically a Thing of the Last 2 Months? I've had it on repeat constantly since then, it kept me company through many of the evenings I spent working on the site update. <span class="subtletext">Lo-fi beats to crash out over compile errors to or something idk</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            I like songs that make you feel like you're floating through the clouds <span class="subtletext">(or like that one gif of Goofy in the pool)</span> and Doomer hits that perfectly for me. This is the first song I've heard from Tokyo Manaka but I'm charmed by his sound, I want to listen through the rest of his releases soon. The MV is quite striking too! I spent a couple hours looking through <a href="https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/38480468">ohuton's pixiv archive</a> recently - I recommend taking a peek, their style is a lot of fun and they've even got a few manga you can read through.
        </p>
        <p>All of this to say: if you haven't already heard it, it's worth a listen :] <em>Lay back and dive~</em></p>
