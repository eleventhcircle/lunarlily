        <h3>The ghosts of the things of weeks past</h3>
        <p>Wanna see some previous things of the week? You're in the right place! Entries are posted in reverse chronological order (a.k.a. most recent first). Sometime soon I need to figure out pagination so this doesn't become terrible to scroll through, but for now it's probably alright.</p>

        <h3>But wait, what's a thing of the week?</h3>
        <p>
            Great question! A thing of the week is some Thing I'm particularly fixated on during any given week - there's really no restriction on what the Thing can be. I thought it would be a fun way to document how my interests fluctuate over time and also encourage me to regularly check/update the site when I first launched it.

            *Note: Contrary to expectations set by the name, the thing of the week is usually not updated every single week but rather when I remember or have the time/energy to. Life be happening sometimes, yknow?
