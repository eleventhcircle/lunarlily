    I went on a bit of a stress-induced library hold-placing spree at the end of September (as you do) and now I am reaping what I've sown. Thought it might be fun to share some of the books stacked rather haphazardly upon my headboard right now :]
</p>
<p>
    None of these are reviews because I'm not done reading any of them yet - most I haven't even started! All title links lead to their respective pages on Storygraph (my reading tracker of choice).

    <strong><a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/42a6a165-9b89-472f-b6b2-4fbae18602d6" target="_blank">Secrets of the Silent Witch</a></strong> - <i>Matsuri Isora</i>
</p>
<p>
    A light novel I picked up after stumbling across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIYDFu6ptPA" target="_blank"> a trailer</a> for the anime adaptation, which aired over the summer this year. I've been itching to try more light novels so I figured I might as well give this one a shot! Of this list it's the only book I've actually started. So far it's a good time, but I must admit my progress came to a complete standstill once Grand Bazaar dropped. I started playing that before bedtime instead of reading lol

    <strong><a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/9e12b15c-be24-4b78-bdef-2f442aeca359" target="_blank">Paradise Logic</a></strong> - <i>Sophie Kemp</i>
</p>
<p>
    I put a hold on this one 60% because of a recommendation from my partner and 40% because I lost my shit laughing when he showed me the cover. He said it's pretty fast-paced which is great news for me, because I need to have it back to the library by the end of the week for the next person in line.

</p>

    Grabbed it on Libby because the cover caught my eye. A queer (possibly poly??) historical fiction romance... sounds like it could be up my alley.

    The next few are part of my first proper attempt to dive into nonfiction - maybe a bit embarrassing to admit that I haven't really read any at my age? I bounced off the 2-3 books I tried in grade school and took it as a sign from the universe that I simply would never be able to find any nonfiction writing that I liked so I should just give up entirely and never try again for my whole life. Very reasonable reaction when you're 12 I guess lmao

    As I spend less and less of my screentime on social media and more time exploring the indie web, my curiosity about the history of the internet and the rise of algorithms and platforms (and the resulting "enshittification," as they call it, of technology and the modern web) continues to grow. I've already read through several interesting articles, essays and manifestos, so I figured the logical next step is books! I picked these titles to start, mostly on recommendation from a <a href="https://unplatform.fromthesuperhighway.com/library/" target="_blank">couple</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bdj14_jdumI" target="_blank">different</a> sources.

    Sadly don't have this one in hand right now, my library doesn't have a copy but I put in a purchase request. Hopefully they'll approve it.

    And that's it! The odds of me finishing every single one of these before they're due back to the library are low, but that's alright. I'm just happy to <i>want</i> to read again after a couple months of not picking any books up at all :]
